# Software-Design-Document


Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client, The Gaming Room, wanted a web-browser application called Draw It or Lose IT that allows unique player and team names, with only one instance of a game at a time.  The Gaming Room wanted to reach as many platforms as possible, while keeping a low budget and minimal development time.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I think I did particularly well in choosing Linux as the developing platform and explaining all the benefits of using it, such as web-wrapping, browser-compatibility and explaining the need for SSL protocols even while using the cloud.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

I found reading the UML diagram is really the only thing that helped me develop code.  I wish that earlier classes would have implemented this.  In my opinion, pseudocode, flow charts and UML diagrams are important to learn and make programming much easier.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would probably improve and revise the security section  cloud security is getting a massive update in 2021 and will be as secure, if not more than a traditional server.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I chose the cheapest and most efficient way to get the game to all platforms by using Linux.  Also, database management and storage should be relatively simple to use with third-party cloud storage and MongoDB.  It is important to meet all needs of the client, otherwise, they could hire a different organization to handle the design and get all their needs met.  Also, if the development stage starts and all needs are not met, their could be a large amount of revenue loss for contracted development teams.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

My number one priority was to research each platform and find pros and cons, while also considering budget and time constraints.  I tried find the most efficient and cheap way for development while meeting all the client's needs.
